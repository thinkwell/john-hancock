John Hancock
============

John Hancock is a extendable library for signing and verifying url/request
signatures.  It supports multiple signature algorithms and request formats.
Adding a new signature algorithm is simple.

If you are using [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), take a look
at the [devise\_john\_hancock](https://github.com/thinkwell/devise_john_hancock)
gem which provides authentication using URL signatures.


## Installation

Install as Gem

    gem install john-hancock

via Gemfile

    gem 'john-hancock', '0.0.1'

## Contributing to john-hancock

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
